#@ Using S/N > 6 for detection threshold on zuul
#@ Using beam #/users/amcewen/GBNCC_work/beams_rfi.txt to search for pulsars from tmp2 
#@ Only searched for published pulsars
#@ Flux adjusted for offset from beam center
#@ Exclamation points next to Wcat and Wsmr indicate cases where W50 is not published, so the average ratio of W50/P0 is used
#@ S/Ne = expected S/N estimated from published flux values using width calculated from data
#@ S/Nc = expected S/N calculated using catalog W50
#@ S/Ns = S/N calulated using Weff (smeared out)
#@ S/Nm = measured S/N 
#@ Flux estimated from measured S/N, uncertainty estimated from dependencies
